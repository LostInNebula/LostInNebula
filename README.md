- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GreshB
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: coding (of course), biology, and psychology. I came from a neuroscience background 
- so I enjoy incorporating some of what I learned into my code! Otherwise I make random stuff that I made 
- to challenge myself in my pursuit of becoming a great programmer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Python
